                        Hi there, I'm Ken Dunn. Welcome to my portfolio! <br/><br/>
                        I am a Full Stack Web Developer who feels most successful finding solutions that allow projects to work smoothly. I have a knack for finding and fixing problems that others might miss. Having previously been a Stagehand, I learned the importance of efficiency in each and every task I tackle. I’ve also learned how to work with and explain things to people in different fields, allowing for open and understandable communication across disciplines. I’m changing careers because my passion is in making things that others will find useful. I want to make things that make a difference.<br/>
                        When I was accepted to General Assembly, I was very excited. Learning how to actually code was an interesting prospect. And after going through the course, I have learned so much and have realized that this what my career should be. The fact that I can think both logically and creatively each day in the programming environment is extremely exciting for me. <br/>
                    </p>
                    <br/><br/>
                    <p>
                        Personally, I enjoy board games and video games. I like to read and I like to watch to engaging TV shows. I also enjoy taking trips with my friends, celebrating the positive things in our lives, and playing spikeball and basketball. Also, I look forward to learning what it's like to be a dog dad since I will soon have a new dog in my life for the first time.
                    </p>

                        <p class="description">This is Black-Jack-Black, a game I created with html, css, and javascript that allows you to play Blackjack against the computer. Bet some chips and see how much "money" you can make! And I hope you like Jack Black, because what would Blackjack be without Jack Black! </p>
                        <p class="disclaimer">Disclaimer: This app does not use real money. You cannot gain nor lose money while using this app. It's still fun though, I promise.</p>

                        <p class="description">This is an app that allows the user to manage lists of board games. It is a MERN stack application which utilizes some session and authorization logic as well. When you use this app, you will be able to add games to a few different lists of your choice; games you have, games you want to play, and games you have played. This lets the user keep track of what games they like and what kind of games they like as well!</p>

                        <p class="description">Plant Buddi lets the user keep track of all their plants! This is also a MERN stack application that uses an external API to search for their plants, and keep track of different needs for each of their plants. This project was made with a small group of peers, which helped me to learn what a real world work environment would be like. </p>
