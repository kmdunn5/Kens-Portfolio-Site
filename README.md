## List of Ideas

- Dog Health Tracker-Poops/medicines
- Comic Book Beginners App - You liked a show/movie? Find more info on those characters!

## List of technologies to look at:

- Django
- API (Comic Vine, thdogapi/dog-api)
- MySQL
- Google Maps Integration
- Framework that sorts a table?
- React Native - React Native Table Components
- Deployment - Probably not heroku

## Zukies Dookies

### User Story

As a dog owner, I want to be able to effectively track the wellness of my dog, so that I can stay on track with their vaccination schedule and also use details about my dog's poops to know if I need a vet, provide accurate information to my vet, or know if my dog responds better to certain foods.

### MVP

- Create a User
- Create a Dog owned by a user
- Be able to record vaccinations for the dog
- Be able to track how recent medicines have been given
- Be able to track daily poops and what food the dog is eating at that time

### Stretch Goals

- Add Google Maps for local vets
- Allow a person to share their dog with another user, so that a dog walker can record poops as well
- Sort Framework to be able to list out poops for different foods/dates/etc

## Back To The Books

### User Story

As a fan of media based on comics, I want to be able to associate my favorite movies and TV shows with their related comic books, be able to better understand the origins of my favorite characters, and also find local comic book shops that sell the comics I'm interested in to support small businesses.

### MVP

- Create a User
- Allow user to search for different comic book characters/movies/shows through the api
- Allow user to add characters, shows/movies, and story arcs
- Reference storyarcs, etc, through other models

### Stretch Goals

- Add Google Map for finding local comic book stores to buy comics
- Recommendations?
- Ratings like goodreads

This is the react version of Zookies Dookies. This app features the following technologies:

- Flask
- Flask Login
- React
- Axios
- React Data Table Components
- Material UI
- Styled Components

This app allows the user to log in and/or create an account. Then they can add a dog to their list, and then track some of the medical information for their dog. This will also include the dog's poops!

## Problems I Ran Into

- Too much time spent on data structure
- started react native, didn't have time enough for that
- Too many routes to add into react
- got caught on a lot of small problems
- decided to focus on material ui too late

## Future Features

- Ability to add defaults to poop details
- Upload pictures
- Update dookies, meds, vaccines (and dog)
- Make the show dogs button instead show a random dog and a set number
- Update mobile responsiveness
- Add resume to portfolio
